TODO:

- see TODO's in code comments

- Segment code into classes and files... ex. the functions, dataloader, etc.

- lots of redundancy

- Pass arguments vie cmd line parmaeters

- # TODO LRSched factor the LR decay

- batch the function dataset

- split setup better into __main__ and pool workers

- implement convolutional structures

- set worker number with os.cpu_count()?

- num_workers for dataloader != 0 ?

- cleanup logging and prints a bit

- not all functions fully defined
	- fix multi variable polynome to be smaller and interesting on domain

- Avoid blowup of weights when not clamping by error

- build network with ModuleList / nn.sequential 

- https://docs.python.org/2/library/pickle.html#module-pickle

- freeze version numbers of packages



Stuff:

for leaky and rrelus

http://proceedings.mlr.press/v15/glorot11a/glorot11a.pdf
for strength of relus in depth?

Also helps strongly?

probably not relevant?
